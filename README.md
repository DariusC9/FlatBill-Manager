- FlatBill Manager - iOS app

FlatBill-Manager is an iOS application that offers a good user authentication process, enabling secure access to personalized features. Users can register their homes within the application, facilitating efficient management of household expenses. The platform provides a detailed overview of various fees, including condominium charges, garbage fees, cleaning costs, and water bills.

A standout feature allows users to submit utility indexes such as water and heating readings, streamlining the monitoring of shared utilities within a residential block and also o payment system for theirs bills.
